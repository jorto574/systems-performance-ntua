### Overview

### Setup

#### Creating a python environment (optional)

This step is not needed, but it is certainly very helpful to have an isolated environment with all the packages for the simulation in one place.

To create it execute `python -m venv myenv`.

To activate the environment execute `.\myenv\Scripts\activate` on Windows, or `source myenv/bin/activate` on Unix/iOS.

To deactivate the environment execute `deactivate`.

#### Installing the required packages

Note: To install the packages in your python environment you have to first activate it with the commands written above.

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```
